Matlab simulation scripts to compute shear wave displacements in transverse isotropic media.

This repository contain scripts to:
1. compute the acoustic radiation force (ARF) generated in an isotropic absorbing medium by a linear transducer Philips L7-4
2. compute the harmonic Green's functions for a transverse isotropic medium
3. compute the shear displacements generatedy by the ARF in a transverse isotropic medium

The computation of the ARF generated by the L7-4 can be found in "kwave_example_pushingPulse4D_L7_4.m". You will need to install the Matlab toolbox k-Wave http://www.k-wave.org to run it.
This script generates a mat file called "ARF_L7_4_17p8mFoc_4MHz.mat" in the "Data" folder.

To compute the harmonic Green's functions for a given pulse, run the script "compGreenFuncsMusclePulse.m". This script takes a very long time (several days), so you've been warned!
It produces 25 mat files (one for each frequency) and places them in the "Data" folder.

To compute the shear displacements produced by the ARF run the script "displGridinPulse.m" that will produce the file "displGridinPulse.mat" in the "Data" folder.
The figures shown in the article "Modelling of shear wave propagation in skeletal muscle" F. Prieur, O. Seynnes doi:... can be generated by running the script "showDisplGridinGreenFctsPulse.m"
